# Walkthrough: How can both clients delete the original B while preserving X?

1. Name the initial state in [the code](src/demo.mjs). Separate data, identity, versions and pending messages.
2. Before executing, predict every `assert` from the transition rules in master chapters 9.
3. Run the demo and inspect its JSON trace/result. Locate the state changed by each transition.
4. Change one operation or delivery order. Explain which invariant remains true and which guarantee was never present.
5. Inspect the counterexample and boundary checks in [shared tests](../shared/tests/). Derive a smaller failing trace before fixing a rule.

Mechanism: Pair transforms preserve the deletion target and satisfy the two-operation diamond.

**Scope:** Exactly two clients, one edit each per round, same base; no arbitrary OT control algorithm or TP2 claim.

Design exercise: specify the operation's precondition, effect, identity, causal context and recovery rule. Explain what a second independent authority would change.

Full derivation, equations, transport and architecture comparisons remain in the [single master curriculum](../../GUIDE.md).
